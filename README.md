## ðŸ©¸ CHIC: Clonal Haematopoiesis Inference from Counts
This repo contains the source code and installation scripts required to run the wrapper script used to generate all tree-based ML models in the paper "Machine learning framework for predicting the presence of high-risk clonal haematopoiesis using complete blood count data: a population-based study of 431,531 UK Biobank participants".

## Get set up
Before trying to run the scripts, run the installation script (contained in the scripts/ directory) to install the relevant packages and dependencies.

## Using the framework 
I recommend using the wrapper script, train-ch-models.sh. Full instructions for using this are available if the script is called with the help (-h) argument: 

```bash
./train-ch-models.sh -h
```
